**My research is focused on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that impact population dynamics in a changing world. To study these eco-evolutionary dynamics across the tree of life, I am fortunate to have a broad and interdisciplinary research programme. Here, I summarize a selection of ongoing projects and collaborations that aim to push new frontiers in ecology and evolution.**
